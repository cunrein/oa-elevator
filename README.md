## oa-elevator
An elevator simulator for OA.

It has three elevators to choose from `Simple`, `Time Optimal` and `Willy Wonka`. I hope you enjoy the simulation. 
Instructions for how to build and run the simulations are below.  

This project was kept very simple by design. I wanted to minimize dependencies and keep the jar as small as possible.
For example, this project could have used an argument parsing lib to simplify the `main` function which would violate 
the minimize dependencies rule.

*Note*: This code comes with no warranty whatsoever! So, run at your own risk. There is no licensing on this project you are free 
to use as you see fit. 

## Requirements
Create an elevator simulator and create an executable, or script, that can be run with the following inputs and 
generate the following outputs.
- Inputs: list of floors to visit (e.g elevator start=12 floor=2,9,1,32)
- Outputs: total travel time, floors visited in order (e.g 560 12,2,9,1,32)
- Program Constants: Single floor travel time: 10

## Assumptions
Basic assumptions:
1. All coordinates are in Euclidean space.
2. Pick up and drop off are assumed in the floors to visit.
3. The time constant is hard coded (could have uses and init file but that was a lot of work for a simple program).
4. Floors zero (0) and below (negative numbers) are sub-floors.

Implementation specific details of each elevator is in the description. 

## How to Run
How to build - in the project directory `oa-elevator` run `mvn clean install`. This assumes you have a JDK 8 or higher, have maven 
installed and clone the project without modifications. 
### Using Java 
For the project directory run the following for the simple elevator:
```bash
java -jar ./target/oa-elevator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar startfloor=12 floors=2,9,1,32
```
for the time optimal'ish elevator:
```bash
java -jar ./target/oa-elevator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar o startfloor=12 floors=2,9,1,32
```
for the Willy Wonka elevator:
```bash
java -jar ./target/oa-elevator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar w startfloor=1,2 'floors=(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)'
```
### Using the Script
Move to the `script` folder in project directory and make sure the `oa-elevator.sh` has executable permissions if it 
does not then add it using `chmod +x oa-elevator.sh`. The script assumes that the `oa-elevator.jar` file is located in 
same directory as the script. The jar in this directry was built with java 17, so you will need java 17 or higher to run
the jar. 

Run the following for the simple elevator:
```bash
./oa-elevator startfloor=12 floors=2,9,1,32
```
for the time optimal'ish elevator:
```bash
./oa-elevator  o startfloor=12 floors=2,9,1,32
```
for the Willy Wonka elevator:
```bash
./oa-elevator w startfloor=1,2 'floors=(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)'
```
